# Social Media Platform Backend (MERN Stack)

This is a full-fledged backend for a social media platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The backend supports various features such as user management, video uploads, likes, tweets, subscriptions, watch history, and video views.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register, login, and authenticate users.
- **Video Management**: Upload and manage videos, view counts.
- **Likes**: Users can like/unlike videos.
- **Tweets**: Users can tweet and interact with tweets.
- **Subscription**: Users can subscribe to channels or other users.
- **Watch History**: Track what videos users have watched.
- **Views**: Track the number of views on each video.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store data such as users, videos, likes, tweets, etc.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and routing.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework (This is for reference; your current request is focused on backend).
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to manage schemas and models.

### Key Notes:

1. **Models**: Each data structure (User, Video, Like, Tweet, etc.) is stored in its own Mongoose model. These models represent the key components of your social media platform.
2. **Authentication**: JWT is used to authenticate and authorize users.
3. **API**: Each section of the platform (e.g., videos, likes, tweets) has a set of RESTful endpoints for interaction.
